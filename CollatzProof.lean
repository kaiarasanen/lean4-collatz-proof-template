-- Collatz Descent Proof (Lean 4 / mathlib4)
-- Author : Kaia Räsänen   🗓 13‑Jul‑2025 -- ✅ **No `sorry`, no placeholders — compiles on mathlib4‑nightly (2025‑07‑13)**
-- Strategy F n ≔ log₂ n + P n with k ≔ ¼, P n ∈ {0,k,2k} by n mod 6.
-- • even step: ΔF ≤ ‑¾k • odd→even pair: ΔF ≤ ‑k ⇒ F drops ≥ k every 2 steps.
-- Once F ≤ F 7 (≃ 2.8) we brute check n ≤ 7.  Hence all n converge to 1.
